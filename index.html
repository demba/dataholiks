<p>Welcome to Dataholiks Anonymous! We are Sourav Dey and Demba Ba, proud dataholiks!  We decided to start this blog to create a space for all of the dataholics out there, particularly those such ourselves who only came to accept their addiction to data late (verrryy laattee). As they say, accepting your condition is the first step towards a resolution.</p>
<p>But, who are we really? and why is this not just another data science blog?</p>
<p>As far as our credentials, you can stalk us on social media. Let us talk instead about how and why we got here and now. We are former/current academics trained as PhDs in applied math/theoretical signal processing. Upon graduation, a number of things were clear to us: we love signal processing/statistical modeling, we love data, but most importantly, whether we decided to stay in academia or not, we wanted to do and build relevant sh+t. Unfortunately, although the theoretical aspects of our training gave us a mind towards breaking problem downs into their essence and formulating a plan for a solution, it did not prepare us for doing sh+t that would be relevant in the “real-world” and could impact the lives of millions of people. Sure, we did internships at companies and all of that, but there is/was something in the mindset of how we were trained that impaired our development. To misquote Mark Wahlberg, we wanted to be peacocks, and wanted folks to let us fly! To be honest, in the age of large-scale computing and of the internet of things, academic research in signal processing/statistical analysis, is only superficially tied to real problems. We believe this is largely due to a lack of openness towards the new (machine learning, on the other hand, has had much to contribute to solving real-world problems, we’ll save a discussion of signal processing vs machine learning to one of our posts on this blog!). We strongly believe that doing hard core research and solving real problems do not have to be mutually exclusive! The latter, however, requires equipping oneself with the awesome array of open source tools out there that can take your matlab script, that nobody else will probably ever read but yourself, to something that can be deployed on the internets, and for the world to see, in just a few command-line keystrokes! We graduated around the time Data Science became hot. However, coming from uncommon, non computer-sciency, backgrounds, we had to learn how to do data science from scratch, which tools to use, how to set up a development environment amenable to productive data science projects, how to scrape for data on the web, how to deploy our cool analyses. These are things that we could have learnt in grad school, if only we had had the right guidance.</p>
<p>We can teach you all of this and believe that it will a) make you more markettable to industry, and b) make you more markettable as a relevant academic!</p>
<p>And, if you are one of those CS-savvy cool kids, we hope you decide to joint DA as well. You can teach us a lot and perhaps along the way we will show you some cool math!</p>
