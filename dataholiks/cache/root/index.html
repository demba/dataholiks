        <p>DataHoliks works across the spectrum of data science -- from the initial stages, when a concrete question has
            yet to be formulated, to the final implementation of production code. Our focus has been on technology
            startups and midsize businesses because we have found that they derive the most value from targeted data
            science solutions. Our work is varied, but typically falls into two categories described below. The first
            impacts your revenue, while the second impacts your product.

                    <p>We use data science to surface insights about your business that affect the bottom line. More
                        importantly, we have extensive experience in helping you leverage the learnings across the
                        different departments in your firm from customer success to sales. We deliver solutions as
                        internal tools, dashboards, detailed reports, and training seminars.</p>

                    <p>In the past, we have helped our clients answer questions such as:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Who are my most valuable customers and what features of my product matter to them?</li>
                        <li>If I invest engineering resources in developing a feature what is the expected effect on
                            revenue?
                        </li>
                        <li>How can I improve my sales process to better qualify customers?</li>

                    <img src="../images/strategy.png" class="img-responsive center-block">
                    <p>We develop data-science driven products using state of the art machine learning techniques
                        deployed in the cloud. We collaborate closely with your engineering team to deliver production
                        code that is tested, scalable, and ready for deployment. We have specialized expertise in
                        Internet of Things (IoT) products -- where the data is from sensors interfacing to the physical
                        world. Our team has a deep background in signal processing and wireless communication that is
                        particularly suited to IoT applications because we can design the appropriate split between
                        algorithms running on embedded devices in the field and algorithms running in the cloud.

                    <p>In the past, we have developed data products that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Optimize the HVAC start time for a commercial buildings to save energy.</li>
                        <li>Attribute energy consumption in a home to different factors</li>
                        <li>Determine the occupancy of a home from a indoor sensor network.</li>
                        <li>Forecast electricity consumption and demand response load shed on the electrical grid.</li>
                        <li>Optimize irrigation system operation based on soil and weather measurements.</li>
                        <li>Optimally route cars to minimize the time to find street parking.</li>
